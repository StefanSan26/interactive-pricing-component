## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript vanilla

### What I learned

In this challenge i practiced the fundamentals of HTML and CSS i`ve been learning this months.
But the most important is that this time i added some Javascript to the project as it was necessary to change the prices and the pageviews would recieve the client. The challenging part of this was the switch of yearly and monthly billign to add a disccount. 
To make this posible i had to get the elements from the HTMl and save into variables, then add eventlisteners and finally make the functions that would make the changes in to the page.

### Continued development

My focus in this moment is to practice more on javascript and make more functional websites üòÅ
